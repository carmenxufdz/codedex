## Introduction
Do you pronounce it ‚ÄúGIF‚Äù or a ‚ÄúJIF‚Äù? Either way, Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is great for creating animated images. The format has been around since 1987 and helped define the early internet. It‚Äôs used to display memes, graphics, logos, and they are everywhere ‚Äî on websites, text messages, and social media.

GIFs are ‚Äúanimated images‚Äù because they aren‚Äôt exactly videos. They are more like flipbooks; they don‚Äôt have sound and flip through multiple pictures sequentially.

In this project tutorial, I will show you how to combine multiple images and create a GIF using just 6 lines of Python code! More specifically, a list, a for loop, and a library called imageio.

Here‚Äôs a preview of the project:

## ImageIO Library
Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data. It runs on Python 3.5 and above.

Suppose you have Python and pip the package installer on your computer. In that case, you can install imageio using this command in the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):

<>pip install imageio<>

## Writing the Program
Let‚Äôs open up a code editor like VS Code and create a new file called create_a_gif.py.

To use the imageio library, you need to import it in your code. The "v3" in the import statement means you're using version 3 of the imageio library:
```
import imageio.v3 as iio
```

The as part allows you to give the library a shorter name to work with (a nickname/alias), making it more convenient. So we've renamed imageio.v3 as iio moving forward.

Now, run the code to make sure it works. Hopefully there's no error!

Here are two images that you can use for this project (feel free to use your own!):

team-pic1.png

team-pic2.png

üí° Make sure to store the image files in the same folder as your Python program file.

In our Python program, we'll create a list that contains the locations of the image files. We also need to create an empty list that will be used to store the actual image data from these files.
```
filenames = ['team-pic1.png', 'team-pic2.png']
images = [ ]
```

Next, let‚Äôs use a for loop to go through the file paths and read the images using imageio library‚Äôs .imread() method:
```
for filename in filenames:
  images.append(iio.imread(filename))
```
The .imread() method loads an image based on the file path. So now, our images variable has all the images!

Lastly, let‚Äôs use the .imwrite() method to turn the images into a GIF:
```
iio.imwrite('team.gif', images, duration = 500, loop = 0)
```
This takes in four arguments:

'team.gif': This is the name you want to give to your new GIF file.

images: The list containing the image data.

duration = 500: How long each picture should show in the GIF, in milliseconds.

loop = 0: How many times the GIF should repeat (0 means it keeps looping forever).

And that‚Äôs it! Here‚Äôs the whole program:
```
import imageio.v3 as iio

filenames = ['team-pic1.png', 'team-pic2.png']
images = [ ]

for filename in filenames:
  images.append(iio.imread(filename))

iio.imwrite('team.gif', images, duration = 500, loop = 0)
```
Let‚Äôs run this program and see what happens! A new team.gif should appear:
