# Snapple Facts
# Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. 
# Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

# Use the random module to create a number from 0 to 5.

# Then use an if/elif/else statement to print out one of 
# these six random Snapple facts:
#   0 - 'Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.'
#   1 - 'The only food that doesn't spoil is honey.'
#   2 - 'Shrimp can only swim backwards.'
#   3 - 'A taste bud's life span is about 10 days.'
#   4 - 'It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.'
#   5 - 'It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.'
